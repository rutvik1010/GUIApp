# Project-GUI

Some of the functionalities in this project might not work(I have stopped updating the code) as I am currently learning new libraries, languages and doing other projects.

My First GUI application using Python(tkinter and beautiful soup)

Developed a GUI application using the Tkinter, requests and Beautiful Soup (for web scraping) modules in Python. The application has 3 quick launch icons along with other Tiles which when clicked provide information such as “NEWS”, Weather (Temperature: min and max, wind, sunset and sunrise times), a “Word of the Day” tile which shows the word and its meaning. The application has a text-to-speech feature to read the Weather and “Word of the Day”. It also has a “To Do List” which can be edited and saved.

References:
None of the data and images used are mine, I used the data from the following websites to create this project.
ndtv for the data related to the NEWS tile
merriam webster for the data related to the word of the day tile
